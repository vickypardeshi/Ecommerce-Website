# Ecommerce-Website

In this project I will implement "Admin Dashboard" and "Ecommerce site (User End)".                                                                          

In Admin Dashboard Features like -                                             
1) Admin add / delete products in my Ecommerce website.
2) Update Ordered Status (Ordered, Packed, Shipped, Delivered).                                             

In Ecommerce site (User End) Features like -                                                  
1) Add to Cart.

3) Pay amount and Confirm order.
